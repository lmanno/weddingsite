                    <p>Hello friends, family, and internet strangers. Like the header says, we're getting married on August 6, 2016, up in Sonoma. We've made this wedding website to share some information with you and because in California you're not allowed to get married without one.</p>
                    <p>Please note that this is still a work in progress, and that logistical and other details may be added or updated as we get closer to the wedding.</p>

                    <p class="text-left">The wedding ceremony and reception will take place on Saturday, August 6th, 2016, at the <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Garden+Pavilion,+Arnold+Dr,+Sonoma,+CA+95476/" class="btn-link" style="color: white; text-decoration: underline;">Garden Pavilion</a>, a private home in Sonoma, CA. The venue is 10 minutes from the town of Sonoma, 20 minutes from neighboring Napa and Petaluma, and one hour from downtown San Francisco. Its address is 23450 Arnold Drive Sonoma, CA 95476.</p>
                    <p class="text-left">There are a variety of wonderful housing options through Airbnb, VRBO, and Homeaway close to the venue. We think these would be a great and cost-effective option for guests comfortable driving or taking a taxi or Uber to and from the celebration.</p>
                    <p class="text-left">For those interested in a reasonably priced hotel option where transportation will be provided to and from the wedding on Saturday, we are in the process of securing a block of rooms at the <a href="http://bestwesterncalifornia.com/hotels/best-western-petaluma-inn" class="btn-link" style="color: white; text-decoration: underline;">Best Western Petaluma</a> (20 minutes from the venue). We will not be able to officially block the rooms until early February and will likely get a slight discount on rates once we do block the rooms.</p>
                    <p class="text-left">We also recommend <a href="http://www.vineyardinnsonoma.com/" class="btn-link" style="color: white; text-decoration: underline;">The Vineyard Inn</a> (.5 miles from the venue) and <a href="http://www.sheratonsonoma.com/" class="btn-link" style="color: white; text-decoration: underline;">Sheraton Petaluma</a> as slightly more expensive, but good hotel options. Please let them know you are guests of our wedding if you decide to book rooms at either place.</p>
                    <p class="text-left">Airbnb, VRBO and hotel rooms will fill up quickly for the summer, so we encourage those able to attend the wedding to secure your housing as soon as possible.</p>
                    <p class="text-left">Please know that there are many other great hotels in San Francisco, Napa, Sonoma, and the surrounding towns, so feel free to reach out with any questions about the area!</p>

                    <p class="text-left">Up in Sonoma, we recomend going for a bike ride, tasting some wine or beer, or exploring the hot springs and spas in Calistoga. The towns of Healdsburg, Nana, Sonoma, and St. Helena are also worth a quick visit. As for food, we recommend The Girl and the Fig and the Fremont Diner in Sonoma, Farmstead in St. Helena, and Mustards Grill in Napa.</p>
                    <p class="text-left">Down in the city, Golden Gate Park, Land's End, Twin Peaks and Mt. Sutro, and the Presidio are all great places for a walk. If you like bikes, renting some and riding over the Golden Gate Bridge to Marin is cool. You can get a margarita in Tiburon before catching the ferry back to the city. There's great food everywhere, but we particularly like Arizmendi Bakery, B*Star, Zazie, Nopalito, and most of the Mexican food in the Mission. Laura will tell you to go to La Taqueria, but she is wrong. You should go to Taqueria Cancun.</p>

                    <p>We have been living as more-or-less functional adults for several years now, so we really don't need any more stuff. More importantly, what we want most is to be surrounded by the people that we love on the day of our wedding, and we know that going to weddings is expensive, so please do not feel any obligation to get us a gift.</p>
                    <p>However, if you would like to give us something for our household or honeymoon, we're registered at Zola: <a href="https://www.zola.com/registry/lukeandlaura" class="btn-link" style="color: white; text-decoration: underline;">https://www.zola.com/registry/lukeandlaura</a></p>
